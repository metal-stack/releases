# Releases

This repository contains release notes and release image vectors for metal-stack.

**Please use tagged releases of this repository for ensuring stable updates!**

The metal-stack is a compound of microservices, which all have their individual versions and development progresses. Hence, there is a unique image vector for each metal-stack release describing the set of the latest stable microservices that are compatible with each other.

## Release Flow

When you're a maintainer of a metal-stack project, please get familiar with the release flow as described [here](https://docs.metal-stack.io/stable/developers/release-flow/). Keep an eye on the integration tests as for the integration tests it is essential that _you_ care about their results.

The outcome of integration tests are published in the #integration channel of our [metal-stack Slack workspace](https://metal-stack.slack.com/).
